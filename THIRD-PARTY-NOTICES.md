# Third-Party Notices

RVThereYetHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

Nothing in this repository is derived from, or redistributes any part of,
RV There Yet?.

## MinHook

Fetched from upstream at configure time and compiled into `dxgi.dll`.

- Upstream: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- Version: `v1.3.3`, pinned in CMakeLists.txt as commit
  `9fbd087432700d73fc571118d6a9697a36443d88`
- Unmodified: the upstream sources are compiled as shipped

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine that `src/hde/` is built
from. Both notices appear below exactly as upstream ships them.

## OpenTrack

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.

## RV There Yet?

RV There Yet? and all related names, logos, characters and marks are
trademarks of their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the
game this mod applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right
in them. This project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its
publishers, its engine vendor, or any other rights holder. It redistributes no
game code, no game assets and no proprietary DLLs, and it requires a
legitimately purchased copy of the game. The engine structure offsets, function
addresses and PE fingerprints in the source were derived by the authors through
independent analysis of a legitimately owned copy. They are factual
measurements recorded as numbers. No decompiled game code, no disassembly and
no copied machine-code signatures are stored in this repository: the analysis
tooling under `scripts/` reads any byte signature it needs from a local file
the operator generates from their own install, which is never committed.
